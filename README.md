# Text Generation with a Pre-trained LLM (GPT)

## Overview
This project demonstrates the use of a pre-trained large language model (LLM), specifically GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer), for text generation tasks. The project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook named `Text_Generation_with_a_Pre_trained_LLM_GPT.ipynb`. It provides insights into leveraging GPT models for various natural language processing (NLP) applications.

## Features
- **Text Generation**: Generate coherent and contextually relevant text based on user prompts.
- **Prompt Engineering**: Experiment with different prompts to understand the modelâ€™s behavior.
- **Fine-tuning Exploration**: Explore the potential for fine-tuning the model on custom datasets.
- **Evaluation**: Assess the quality of generated text using metrics like fluency, coherence, and relevance.

## Requirements
To run this project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries (install via `requirements.txt`):
  ```
  transformers
  torch
  numpy
  pandas
  ```

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Text_Generation_with_a_Pre_trained_LLM_GPT.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Text_Generation_with_a_Pre_trained_LLM_GPT
   ```
3. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
2. Open the `Text_Generation_with_a_Pre_trained_LLM_GPT.ipynb` file.
3. Follow the instructions in the notebook to run the text generation tasks.

## How It Works
1. **Loading the Model**: The notebook uses a pre-trained GPT model from the Hugging Face Transformers library.
2. **Generating Text**: Users can input prompts, and the model generates text continuations based on those prompts.
3. **Custom Prompts**: Experiment with various prompt structures to observe how they influence the generated text.

## Example
Input Prompt:
```
Once upon a time in a small village,
```
Generated Text:
```
Once upon a time in a small village, there lived a kind old woman who loved telling stories to the children. Every evening, they would gather around her to hear tales of adventure and magic.
```

## Customization
You can modify the notebook to:
- Use a different pre-trained GPT model.
- Implement additional evaluation metrics.
- Fine-tune the model on your dataset (requires additional resources).
